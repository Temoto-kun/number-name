# number-name

Converts a number into its name.

## Why?

Inspired by [number-to-words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/number-to-words). Thinking I could improve on the code to include
[big integers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/big-integer), I looked for some info and found [Landon Curt Noll's Web page describing
the reconstructed English naming system of numbers](http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/math/number/howhigh.html). I decided to port
his [Perl script](http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/math/number/number) into JavaScript.

## Installation

`number-name` requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), tested with at least **v.5**. It should work with relatively
earlier versions of Node.js (at least v.4). If you find bugs from v.4, kindly create an issue specifying whatever
error message you are getting, and the code snippet of your code using `number-name` (or you may submit PRs of your
fixes, see Contribution below).

The procedures for installing `number-name` are:

1. Install via NPM:

    $ npm install --save @theoryofnekomata/number-name

2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`


## Usage

```javascript
var NumberName = require('@theoryofnekomata/number-name'),

// see https://github.com/Temoto-kun/number-name/tree/master/src/lang for systems
converter = new NumberName({ system: systemObj, fractionType: 'lazy' });

var smallerNumber = -6.9e-42; // Number is OK. Can convert negative numbers just fine.
var largeNumber = '5.0e+303'; // note this is too large for a normal Number, so it is represented as string
var name1 = numberName(smallerNumber); // returns the long fractional name with "...six nine" in the end
var name2 = numberName(largeNumber); // returns "five centillion"
```

It also works in the browser via `<script>` tags.

## Notes

`number-name` is powered by [`big-integer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/big-integer). With this, it can convert:
- `Number`s
- number-like strings

It can convert numbers as high as `1.0e+3006003`. Optimization for much larger numbers is in progress.

## TODO

- [ ] Fully localizable number systems (e.g. custom rules for combining fragments of number words)
- [ ] Implement other `fractionType`s, (only `lazy` (digits) is supported as of 0.2.0, e.g. `0.05` => `zero point zero five`,
      will implement `ratio` (`zero and five over one hundred`) and `part` (`zero and five hundredths`))
- [ ] Upon adding more features, update the unit tests as well.

## Contribution

Sure thing! Just clone the repo.

`number-name` uses [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io) for unit tests, and
[ESLint](http://eslint.org) to make sure code is written consistently (and implied it will
run consistently as well).

- Run `npm install` upon initial clone.
- Run `npm test` and make sure all the tests pass and properly written.
- Run `npm run lint` to ensure consistency of your code (make sure to install ESLint first).
- Create PRs so that I can confirm and merge your contributions.
